    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) By analyzing different years where a big event occurred, we could identify similar patterns where magnitude in events throughout the year was increasing slowly until the main earthquake happened<br>\n",

For this part, we will need to think about how are we going to consider the starting point to calculate the time for every event.

All the participants join the study at certain point and we record the time that passed since they joined (starting point) until the event in interest happened (i.e. death of the patient) or the patient's data becomes censored. The patient's data becomes censored when we can no longer determine if the event really happened or not. For example, follow up on some patient could be lost by any reason (they moved to another city) or the time of the study could be finished before the event happens, so we don't know what happened after this point. In all of these cases, we handle the data as censored data."

In the following image (Fig.1), on the left side, we can see that there are different points when a participant (participants A to H) joined the study. In our case, every starting point of a participant will be the ending point of the last event in the same class. For example, if we consider participants A and F to be on the same class, then, the ending point of A will the starting point of F, just as shown in the image. A similar situation happens with participants C and G. This is how we will consider the times to event. After we consider the starting and ending point of each participant, we can obtain the total time elapsed for each of them, just as shown in the right part of Fig.1.<br><br>\n",

But, if we look carefully at rows with index 1 and 2 of the dataframe shown above, we can see that both rows correspond to the same state and almost same latitude and longitude. If we check the value in 'Time_to_event' for row number 2, we see 66684 seconds (~0.77 days). This implies that this event is a foreshock of the first one. To try to avoid this 'duplicity' of information we will establish a threshold and eliminate rows with low values in 'Time_to_event'.

    "Another interesting point is that the lowest survival probability event is the one with Magnitude = 7.6. This means that we might expect for an event like this to have ~ 90% probability to happen within 0.2*10^9 seconds(~ 6.3 years) from the last event in the same State and Magnitude >= 6.0. Both events in BCS (Baja California Sur) look similar, but either of them, has higher risk than the one in MICH (Michoacan)."

    "We checked 5 models in total and during each step, we confirmed that the best model for us was the Random Survival Forest standard model.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We applied the model to 5 samples and tried to obtain insights from the predictions. We confirmed that the model gave us reasonable results by seeing that the sample with a no-big-earthquake class ('Status' = 0) gave us a very high and stable survival probability that went out-of-scope in our time range.<br>On the other hand, the rest of the samples, had a more similar survival probability curve. Looking at the results, we might expect that any of the 4 samples' events happen within 6 and 12 years with a ~ 90% probability."
